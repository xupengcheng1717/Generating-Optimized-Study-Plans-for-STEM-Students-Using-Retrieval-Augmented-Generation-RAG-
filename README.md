# Generating-Optimized-Study-Plans-for-STEM-Students-Using-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-
This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to overcome LLM limitations. By integrating a trusted, frequently updated source like the English Wikipedia, and course-relevant sources from NUSMods, EdX and Coursera, we enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated study plans.
